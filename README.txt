Hi there,

About the mod itself:
   This is a tech-based mod focused on electricity and quantum physics. End-game goal would be to make a multi-block particle accelerator, which would be able to produce antimatter by smashing two particles and consuming a massive amount of energy. You would achieve that by collecting a variety of different materials required for crafting, defeating different type of mobs and bosses while traveling to different dimension(s) and building an energy system capable of providing energy to previously mentioned particle accelerator.
   
Main goals:
   Make the mod gameplay enjoyable, bugless and efficient in terms of performance. Current mod iterations are focused on putting more strain on server side, while preserving client side for textures and other visuals loading.
   
Main problems:
   Slow electricity flow between cables at a large distances (need to develop a new system or implement path-finding algorithm).
   
Version (state):
   This mod is still in an EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE.
   Will be used in 1.19.2 Forge version (probably).
